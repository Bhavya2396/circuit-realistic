# Templatizing for Other Physics Simulations: A Guide

This 3D circuit project, while specific to electricity, establishes a robust framework that can be adapted to visualize various other physics principles. The key is to identify analogous components, interactions, and visual representations.

## 1. Core Architectural Components to Leverage

-   **`main.js` (Orchestrator):**
    -   **Scene Setup:** The pattern of initializing a scene, camera, renderer, lights, and controls is universal for any 3D physics visualization.
    -   **Object Placement:** The logic for placing and orienting 3D objects (representing physical entities) in the scene is directly reusable.
    -   **Animation Loop (`animate`):** The core loop for updating object states, animations, and rendering is fundamental.
    -   **Event Handling:** Mouse/keyboard interaction logic can be adapted for user input to control the simulation.

-   **`componentFactory.js` (Visual Entity Factory):
    -   **Concept:** This can be renamed to `entityFactory.js` or similar. Its role is to procedurally generate the 3D meshes and materials for *any* physical objects in your new simulation (e.g., planets, lenses, fluid containers, springs, magnetic fields).
    -   **Materials:** The PBR materials (`MeshStandardMaterial`) and their properties (`color`, `metalness`, `roughness`, `opacity`, `emissive`) are versatile for representing diverse physical substances.
    -   **Geometries:** Three.js offers a wide array of geometries (`SphereGeometry`, `BoxGeometry`, `CylinderGeometry`, `PlaneGeometry`, `LatheGeometry`, `TubeGeometry`, `ExtrudeGeometry`, custom `BufferGeometry`) that can model many physical shapes.

-   **`sceneConfig.js` (Environment Setup):
    -   **Reusable:** The functions for creating renderers, cameras, and basic lighting setups are broadly applicable. Lighting might need adjustment based on the new simulation's aesthetic and focus.

-   **`[YourPhenomenon]Manager.js` (e.g., `OpticsManager.js`, `GravityManager.js`):
    -   **Analogous to `CircuitManager.js` and `ElectronManager.js`:** This new manager would encapsulate the specific rules, state, and interactions of the physics principle being simulated.
    -   It would control the state of visual entities from `componentFactory.js`.
    -   It would handle the logic for any animated elements (like light rays, particle trajectories, field lines).

## 2. Adapting for Different Physics Principles: Examples

### Example A: Optics Simulation (Ray Tracing)

-   **Visual Entities (`componentFactory.js`):
    -   Lenses (convex, concave): Use `LatheGeometry` or combine sphere segments.
    -   Mirrors: `PlaneGeometry` or curved surfaces with highly reflective materials.
    -   Light Sources: Small emissive objects (spheres, points).
    -   Light Rays: `TubeGeometry` or `LineSegments` (similar to electron paths).
-   **`OpticsManager.js`:
    -   **State:** Properties of lenses (focal length, refractive index), mirror positions, light source properties.
    -   **Logic:** Implement Snell's Law for refraction, law of reflection. Calculate ray paths based on interactions with optical elements.
    -   **Interaction:** Allow user to move lenses, mirrors, light sources, or change their properties.
    -   **Visualization:** Animate light rays, show focal points, virtual/real images.
-   **`main.js` Adaptation:**
    -   Place optical elements.
    -   `OpticsManager` updates ray paths in the animation loop.

### Example B: Newtonian Gravity (Orbital Mechanics)

-   **Visual Entities (`componentFactory.js`):
    -   Celestial Bodies (planets, stars, moons): `SphereGeometry` with appropriate materials (textured or colored).
    -   Orbital Paths (optional): `LineSegments` or `TubeGeometry` to trace orbits over time.
-   **`GravityManager.js`:
    -   **State:** Mass, position, velocity of each celestial body.
    -   **Logic:** Implement Newton's law of universal gravitation (`F = Gm1m2/r^2`). Calculate forces, update accelerations, velocities, and positions of bodies in each time step (`deltaTime` from the animation loop).
    -   **Interaction:** Allow user to set initial conditions (mass, velocity, position) or add/remove bodies.
-   **`main.js` Adaptation:**
    -   Place initial celestial bodies.
    -   `GravityManager` updates positions in the animation loop.

### Example C: Fluid Dynamics (Simple Particle-Based)

-   **Visual Entities (`componentFactory.js`):
    -   Fluid Particles: Small `SphereGeometry` instances.
    -   Container/Boundaries: `BoxGeometry` or custom shapes, possibly with collision detection properties.
    -   Obstacles: Various geometries.
-   **`FluidManager.js`:
    -   **State:** Position, velocity of each fluid particle. Container boundaries.
    -   **Logic:** Simple particle interaction rules (e.g., Lennard-Jones potential for repulsion/attraction), collision detection with boundaries and obstacles, basic pressure/density effects (visualized by particle concentration).
    -   **Interaction:** Allow user to inject particles, move obstacles, change fluid properties (viscosity through particle interaction damping).
-   **`main.js` Adaptation:**
    -   Define container and obstacles.
    -   `FluidManager` updates particle positions and handles collisions.

## 3. Key Steps for Templatizing

1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** What are the fundamental laws, entities, and interactions?
2.  **Map to Visuals:** How can these entities and interactions be represented in 3D?
    -   What shapes (geometries)?
    -   What appearances (materials)?
    -   What animations (particle movement, object transformation)?
3.  **Design the `[Phenomenon]Manager`:** This is the new brain. What state does it need to track? What calculations must it perform each frame?
4.  **Adapt `componentFactory.js`:** Create functions to generate the new 3D visual entities.
5.  **Modify `main.js`:** Instantiate your new manager, place your entities, and call your manager's update method in the animation loop.
6.  **User Interaction:** How will the user control or explore the simulation?

By following this pattern, the structure of the 3D circuit simulator provides a solid foundation for building a wide variety of other interactive 3D physics simulations.
